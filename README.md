## 🚀 Running Locally

This project uses Vite for a fast and modern development experience.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 18 or higher recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- Your Google Gemini API Key.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Your API Key

Create a new file named `.env` in the root of the project directory. Add your Gemini API key to this file:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE
```

The application is configured to use this environment variable for local development. This file is included in `.gitignore` and should never be committed to your repository.

### 4. Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server. Open your browser and navigate to the URL it provides, which is typically `http://localhost:5173`.
